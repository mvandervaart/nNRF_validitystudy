Establishing a standardised approach for the measurement of neonatal noxious-evoked brain activity in response to an acute somatic nociceptive heel lance stimulus - scripts for figures and analysis

These are the scripts used in the analysis of data for a study that was pre-registered as a protocol at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZY9MS. 

These scripts are used to (i) perform analyses for preregistered outcome neutral checks, and for hypotheses 1, 2 and 3; (ii) to perform an exploratory meta-analysis; and (iii) to generate the Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the main manuscript. 

Data collection for the Exeter dataset used in this study took place between June 2021 and February 2023.
